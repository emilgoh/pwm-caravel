# Three Phase Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) with Dead Time
Author: Emil Goh

## Background
Three-phase PWM is a crucial technique to enable efficient and precise control of electrical energy in various applications, and is fundamental in driving motors and managing power systems to facilitate a smooth conversion of electrical energy.

As the world's demand for automation through robots and drones, and renewable energy systems, such as solar inverters and wind turbines, increases rapidly, it has made the integration of this technique even more important.  

The design has also incorportated dead time which is essential in preventing short circuits, enhancing safety and reliability of the power electronic system.

## Objective
To develop a three phase PWM with dead time that can potentially be integrated as a peripheral in the Caravel harness to control electrical energy for various power electronic systems, using ChatGPT-4 to write the RTL of the design.

## Circuit Design

## Simulation and Results

## LLM Conversational Flowchart

## Reflection and Acknowledgement
Despite coming from an electrical engineering background, I would say that this is the very first time I went through the entire IC design RTL to GDS (and maybe to chip) flow. It has been a refreshing and exciting experience to be a small part of this movement to democratise IC design by submitting a simple design for the AI Generated Open-Source Silicon Design Challenge.

I would like to use this opportunity to thank my mentor, Dr Teo Tee Hui, and Mr Xiang Mao Yang from Singapore University of Technology and Design for the unwavering support and guidance. Also, a big thank you to the Efabless team who has made all these possible.
